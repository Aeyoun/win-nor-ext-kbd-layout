The Norwegian extended keyboard layout is based on the standard Norwegian
keyboard layout for Windows combined with the standard Norwegian keyboard
layout distributed with most Linux variants. It is similar to the keyboard
layout used by Mac OS X and resembles many touch keyboard layouts. See
the layout/ directory for images of the keyboard layout

Works with Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10.

To modify and install from the sources, you need to download and install
Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. (As a caveat, it must be installed to
a path without space or any special characters.)
